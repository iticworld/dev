# CHAPTER 3 BASIC EXECUTION ENVIRONMENT

This chapter describes the basic execution environment of an Inter 64 or IA-32 processor as seen by assembly language programmers.
It describes how the processor executes instructions and how it stores and manipulates data. The execution environment describes here includes memory (the address space), general-purpose data registers, segment registers, the flag registers, and the instruction pointer register.
