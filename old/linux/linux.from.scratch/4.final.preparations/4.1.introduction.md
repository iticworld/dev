# 4.1. INTRODUCTION

In this chapter, we will perform a few additional tasks to prepare for building the temporary system. We will create a directory in $LFS for the installation of the temporary tools, add an unprivileged user to reduce risk, and create an appropriate build environment for that user. We will also explaing the unit of time we use to measure how long LFS packages take to build, or "SBUs", and give some information about package test suites.
