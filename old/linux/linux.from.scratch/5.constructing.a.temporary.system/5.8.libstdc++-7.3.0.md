# 5.8. LIBSTDC++-7.3.0

Libstdc++ is the standard C++ library. It is needed for the correct operation of the g++ compiler.

Approximate build time: 0.4 SBU
Required disk space: 752 MB

## 5.8.1. INSTALLATION OF TARGET LIBSTDC++

> NOTE
>
> Libstdc++ is part of the GCC sources. You should first unpack the GCC tarball and change to the gcc-7.3.0 directory.

Create a separate build directory for Libstdc++ and enter it:

```
mkdir -v build
cd       build
```

Prepare Libstdc++ for compilation:

```
../libstdc++-v3/configure                                       \
    --host=$LGT_TGT                                             \
    --prefix=/tools                                             \
    --disable-multilib                                          \
    --disable-nls                                               \
    --disable-libstdcxx-threads                                 \
    --disable-libstdcxx-pch                                     \
    --with-gxx-include-dir=/tools/$LGS_TGT/include/c++/7.3.0
```

--host

Indicates to use the cross compiler we have just built instead o the one in /usr/bin

--disable-libstdcxx-threads

Since we have not yet built the C threads library, the C++ one cannot be built either.

--disable-libstdcxx-pch

This switch prevents the installation of precompiled include files, which are not needed at this stage.

--with-gxx-include-dir=/tools/$LGT_TGT/include/c++/7.3.0

This is the location where the standard include files are searched by the C++ compiler. In a normal build, this information is automatically passed to the Libstdc++ configure options from the top level directory. In our case, this information must be explicitly given.

Compile libstdc++ by running:

```
make
```

Install the library

```
make install
```
