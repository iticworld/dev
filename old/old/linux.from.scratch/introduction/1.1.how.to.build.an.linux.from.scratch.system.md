# 1.1. HOW TO BUILD AN LINUX FROM SCRATCH SYSTEM

The Linux From Scratch system will be built by using an already installed Linux distribution (such as Debian, Open Mandriva, Fedora, or open SUSE). This existing Linux system (the host) will be used as a starting point to provide necessary programs, including a compiler, linker, and shell, to build the new system. Select the "development" option during the distribution installation to be able to access these tools.

As an alternative to installing a separate distribution onto your machine, you may wish to use a LiveCD from a commercial distribution.

Chapter 2 of this book describes how to create a new Linux native partition and file system. This the place where the new Linux From Scratch system will be compiled and installed. Chapter 3 explains which packages and patches need to be downloaded to build an Linux From scratch system and how to store them on the new file system. Chapter 4 discusses the setup of an appropriate working environment. Please read Chapter 4 carefully as it explains several important issues you need be aware of before beginning to work your way through Chapter 5 and beyond.
